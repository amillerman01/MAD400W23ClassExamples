# How to create an angular project without the ng command in the terminal

> In order to use this, you need to have nodejs installed on your computer (minimum version of NodeJS needed is 14.20.x)

1. Download or clone this branch to your computer.
2. Open the terminal in the folder of the repository on your computer (you should see the `package.json` listed if you type `ls` in the terminal).
3. Run `npm install`. This should create and populate a `node_modules` folder.
4. Now you have access to the ng command in the terminal by running the following command:

> `npm run ng `

5. For example, if you wanted to create a new Angular application called "TestingAngular", you could run:

> `npm run ng new TestingAngular`
